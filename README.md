A Zorklike engine for Android

Donjon is a demo of how one might implement a zorklike for the Android platform.

This was my first Android app beyond the classic "Hello, World" and tutorials. The UI is pretty bad.

I chose to use the SQLite subsystem on Android as a way to deal with how Android apps manage state.
It should be easy to make new "worlds" for this Zorklike - just add new SQL files describing the world.

(I did this in 2013 but never published it anywhere until now)
